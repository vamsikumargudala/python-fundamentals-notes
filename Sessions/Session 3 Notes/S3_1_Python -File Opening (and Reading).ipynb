Shallow Copy:**\n","A shallow copy creates a new list, but it does *not* create new copies of the nested objects within the original list. Instead, it copies references to those nested objects. This means that if you modify a nested object in the copied list, the original list's nested object will also be affected because they both refer to the same underlying object.\n","\n","Methods like `list.copy()`, `list()`, `[:]` slicing, and `[*list]` (unpacking) all perform shallow copies.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","b = a.copy() # Shallow copy\n","\n","b[0][0] = 99\n","print(f\"Original list 'a': {a}\") # Output: [[99, 2], [3, 4]] - 'a' was affected!\n","print(f\"Shallow copied list 'b': {b}\") # Output: [[99, 2], [3, 4]]\n","```\n","\n","**2. Deep Copy:**\n","A deep copy creates a new list and recursively creates new independent copies of *all* objects found in the original list, including nested objects. This ensures that the copied list and its contents are entirely independent of the original list. Changes to the deep-copied list or its nested elements will not affect the original list.\n","\n","To perform a deep copy, you typically use the `copy.deepcopy()` function from Python's `copy` module.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","import copy\n","\n","a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","c = copy.deepcopy(a) # Deep copy\n","\n","c[0][0] = 100\n","print(f\"Original list 'a': {a}\") # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] - 'a' remains unchanged!\n","print(f\"Deep copied list 'c': {c}\") # Output: [[100, 2], [3, 4]]\n","```\n","\n","**Summary:**\n","*   Use **shallow copy** when your list contains only immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples) or non-nested mutable objects, or when you specifically want changes in nested objects to reflect across both lists.\n","*   Use **deep copy** when your list contains nested mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) and you need complete independence between the original and the copied structure."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9a59b256","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768105705118,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Sameera K M","userId":"17914871702314294562"}},"outputId":"fd6de9dc-8c96-4315-ce27-500c7b809442"},"source":["import copy\n","\n","# Original nested list\n","a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","print(f\"Original list 'a': {a}\\n\")\n","\n","# --- Shallow Copy ---\n","print(\"--- Demonstrating Shallow Copy ---\")\n","b = a.copy() #
